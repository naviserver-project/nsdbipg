This is the nsdbipg database driver. It connects a Postgres database
to a NaviServer web server using the nsdbi interface.

It provides no new commands. See nsdbi.n for database command details.

For building, you might use e.g.

    PG=/usr/local/pg965 && make PGLIB=$PG/lib PGINCLUDE=$PG/include
or
    PGPATH=postgresql16 && make PGLIB=/opt/local/lib/$PGPATH/ PGINCLUDE=/opt/local/include/$PGPATH/

Configuration example: sample-config.tcl

Generic DBI interface: https://bitbucket.org/naviserver/nsdbi/
