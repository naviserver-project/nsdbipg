This is the nsdbipg database driver. It connects a Postgres database
to a NaviServer web server using the nsdbi interface.

It provides no new commands. See nsdbi.n for database command details.

For building, you might use e.g.

   make PGLIB=/opt/local/lib/postgresql93/ PGINCLUDE=/opt/local/include/postgresql93/

See sample-config.tcl for setup details.
